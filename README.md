# Soviet Keyswitch Replacement
Replacement designs for Soviet-era key switches.

## ВМ16 (VM16)
This key switch comes in blocks of varying sizes that can be cut to size as required.<br>

I have designed a 1x4 replacement that can be cut down as required.<br>

This diagram (from the Микроша manual) shows how it works.<br>
